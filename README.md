# DocSetExplorer

DocSetExplorer is a learning tool I wrote to help myself explore the Core Data model that Apple uses in its docsets.  It won't have much use for you unless you happen to be interested in docset internals.  In particular, DocSetExplorer is **not** a general-purpose documentation browser.

DocSetExplorer assumes you have a docset installed for at least one of Apple's SDKs.  It looks for them in ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets.  There is a popup button in the upper left of the window that lets you select which docset you want to browse.
